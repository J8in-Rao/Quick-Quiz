![Quick Quiz Logo](app/src/main/res/drawable/app_icon.xml)

## 📱 Project Overview

**Quick Quiz** is a modern Android quiz application built with Kotlin, featuring a beautiful glassmorphism UI design. This project was developed as part of my BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications) internship program to demonstrate practical Android development skills and modern UI/UX design principles.

### 🎯 Key Features

- **Modern Glassmorphism UI**: Beautiful transparent design with gradient backgrounds and blur effects
- **Interactive Multiple Choice Questions**: Smooth interactions with visual feedback
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Animated progress bar showing quiz completion
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Prevents accidental quiz exits with user-friendly confirmations
- **Educational Explanations**: Detailed explanations for each question after submission

### 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Platform**: Android
- **UI Framework**: Material Design 3 with custom glassmorphism components
- **Build Tool**: Gradle


### Important 
- ** There is a compatablity issue with gradle and jdk i cant figure out. :(

### Key Components

1. **Data Models**:
   - `Question`: Parcelable data class for quiz questions with options and explanations
   - `Quiz`: Container for multiple questions with scoring logic
   - `QuizResult`: Comprehensive result data with percentage calculation

2. **UI Activities**:
   - `MainActivity`: Welcome screen with app introduction
   - `QuizActivity`: Core quiz functionality with question display and interaction
   - `ResultActivity`: Results display with performance analysis

3. **Utilities**:
   - `PreferencesManager`: SharedPreferences wrapper for data persistence

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Features

### Glassmorphism Design
The app implements modern glassmorphism design principles:
- **Transparent backgrounds** with subtle opacity
- **Gradient overlays** for depth and visual appeal
- **Blur effects** using drawable layers

### Animation System
- **Question transitions**: Smooth slide-in animations for new questions
- **Button transformations**: Submit button morphs into Next button with fade effects
- **Progress animations**: Animated progress bar updates with ObjectAnimator
- **Result feedback**: Scale and fade animations for answer results

### Interactive Feedback
- **Color-coded responses**: Green for correct, red for incorrect answers
- **Visual state management**: Button states change based on user selection

## 📋 Features Deep Dive

### 1. Quiz Flow Management
```kotlin
// Smooth question navigation with state management
fun displayCurrentQuestion() {
    // Reset state, animate transitions, update progress
}

// Intelligent answer validation
fun submitAnswer() {
    // Validate selection, show results, provide feedback
}
```


## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Flamingo or later
- JDK 8 or higher
- Android SDK 24+

## 📊 Learning Outcomes

During this internship project, I gained valuable experience in:

### Technical Skills Developed

1. **Android Development Fundamentals**:

2. **Kotlin Programming**:
   - Data classes and sealed classes
   - Extension functions
   - Coroutines for asynchronous operations
   - Lambda expressions and higher-order functions

3. **UI/UX Design**:
   - Glassmorphism design implementation
   - Custom drawable creation
   - Animation frameworks (ObjectAnimator, ViewPropertyAnimator)
   - Responsive layout design with ConstraintLayout

4. **Data Management**:
   - SharedPreferences for local data storage
   - Parcelable implementation for data passing
   - Data binding architecture

5. **User Experience Enhancement**:
   - Haptic feedback integration
   - Confirmation dialogs for better UX
   - Visual feedback systems
   - Accessibility considerations

### Problem-Solving Experience

1. **Layout Challenges**:
   - **Issue**: Complex glassmorphism effects with proper layering
   - **Solution**: Implemented multi-layer drawable resources with gradients and transparency

2. **Animation Coordination**:
   - **Issue**: Smooth transitions between submit and next buttons
   - **Solution**: Created coordinated animation sequences using AnimationListener

3. **State Management**:
   - **Issue**: Managing quiz state across configuration changes
   - **Solution**: Implemented proper state saving and ViewBinding patterns

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - **Issue**: Smooth animations on lower-end devices
   - **Solution**: Optimized drawable resources and used hardware acceleration

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
