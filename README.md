## üé® UI/UX Design Features

### Glassmorphism Design
The app implements modern glassmorphism design principles:
- **Transparent backgrounds** with subtle opacity
- **Gradient overlays** for depth and visual appeal
- **Blur effects** using drawable layers
- **Elevated cards** with proper shadow and highlighting

### Animation System
- **Question transitions**: Smooth slide-in animations for new questions
- **Button transformations**: Submit button morphs into Next button with fade effects
- **Progress animations**: Animated progress bar updates with ObjectAnimator
- **Result feedback**: Scale and fade animations for answer results

### Interactive Feedback
- **Haptic feedback** with customizable intensity levels
- **Color-coded responses**: Green for correct, red for incorrect answers
- **Visual state management**: Button states change based on user selection

## üìã Features Deep Dive

### 1. Quiz Flow Management
```kotlin
// Smooth question navigation with state management
fun displayCurrentQuestion() {
    // Reset state, animate transitions, update progress
}

// Intelligent answer validation
fun submitAnswer() {
    // Validate selection, show results, provide feedback
}
```

### 2. Haptic Feedback System
```kotlin
enum class FeedbackType {
    LIGHT,    // Option selection
    MEDIUM,   // Button presses
    SUCCESS,  // Correct answers
    ERROR     // Incorrect answers
}
```

### 3. Statistics Tracking
- **Best Score Persistence**: Automatically saves and displays personal best
- **Completion Tracking**: Counts total quizzes completed
- **Accuracy Calculation**: Overall accuracy percentage across all attempts
