# Radio Button Fix Summary

## Problem Fixed:
The AAPT error "attribute android:cx not found" was caused by using `<circle>` elements in vector drawables, which AAPT was having trouble processing.

## Solution Applied:
1. **Replaced `<circle>` elements with `<path>` elements** in both radio button icons
2. **Simplified the radio button background** to avoid complex layer-list issues
3. **Updated QuizActivity** to manually handle radio button icons using compound drawables

## Files Modified:
- `ic_radio_checked.xml` - Fixed vector drawable syntax
- `ic_radio_unchecked.xml` - Fixed vector drawable syntax  
- `radio_button_background.xml` - Simplified background
- `QuizActivity.kt` - Added manual icon management

## Result:
✅ AAPT errors resolved
✅ Radio buttons now work with proper glassmorphism styling
✅ Icons update correctly when selection changes
✅ Compatible with minimum SDK 24

The quiz app now has fully functional RadioButtons with glassmorphism design that work correctly with the Submit → Result → Next workflow!
